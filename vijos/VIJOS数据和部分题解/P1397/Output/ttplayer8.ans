Paul Potts-Cavatina
LRC by: Monty Qian
She was beautiful,
Beautiful to my eyes.
From the moment I saw her,
The sun filled the sky.
 
She was so so beautiful,
Beautiful just to hold.
In my dreams she was spring time
Winter was cold.
 
How could I tell her
What I so clearly could see
Though I longed for her
I never trusted me completely
So I never could be free.
 
It was so so beautiful
Knowing now that she cared
I will always remember
Moments that we shared
 
For it was beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful to be loved.
