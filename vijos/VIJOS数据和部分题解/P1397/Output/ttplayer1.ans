 
Why am I standing alone in the twilight
Let me go,no more lonely nights
I take a deep breath under the bazy sky
Feel like losing, but it's gonna be alright
 
Break through the night, go and try to fight
Don't be afraid,now is the time
 
Be alive,take it
I surely feel my heartbeat
There's no limit to my reach
I say good-bye to my tears that I don't need
So believe in my dream
 
Don't look back to the sorrow I left behind
Here's my real intention I hide
I wish you were here, and so just right by my side
Need to be strong enough to swallow my pride
 
I have been looking for my onw style
Don't give it up,here comes the life
 
Be alive,take it
I have leained a great deal
Brighten our sweet memories
Hope there will be a future for you and me
So believe in your dream
 
Be alive, take it
Promise to find, yes I will
Shining wings filled with wishes
Fly high, make it
Get to the new world that I seek
Someday, so I Believe
